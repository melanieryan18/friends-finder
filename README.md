# Friends-Finder

*What Friends Finder Does*
Friends Finder is essentially a dating and friend-making app. This full-stack site takes in results from user surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Friend Finder determines the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:
    - Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
    - With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. 
    - Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.
